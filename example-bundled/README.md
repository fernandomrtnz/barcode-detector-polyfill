This example demonstrates how to include dependency `zbar.wasm` in a bundle
instead of having it loaded at runtime from a CDN as demonstrated in `/example`.

~~:warning: This may violate the LGPL licenses of [zbar-wasm](https://github.com/undecaf/zbar-wasm)
and [zbar](https://github.com/mchehab/zbar).~~
